# Techscape-Dashboard

TechScape Singapore is an imaginary technology company that specializes in providing a comprehensive range of electronics and smart solutions. From computers and smart devices to televisions and phones, TechScape offers a diverse portfolio of technologically advanced products that cater to various needs and preferences. They have branches in different parts of Singapore and are looking into expanding their business operations.
With the rapid growth of e-commerce and the increasing demand for hassle-free online shopping, TechScape recognizes the importance of adapting to the digital landscape. The launch of the online sales platform in 2021 reflects TechScape's commitment to meeting the evolving needs and preferences of its customers.
The CEO of TechScape has decided to setup a Business Analytics team, which will provide Business Intelligence reports and analysis to assist the management in making decisions. 

My task as a Business Analyst is to analyse the underlying data and create relevant and useful dashboards to aid managerial decision making using the given data in the CSV file. The management should be able to make use of the dashboards to identify critical patterns and trends to plan targeted campaigns to achieve the business objectives of the company.

I created dashboards using the dataset provided to allow stakeholders to answer the following questions to improve the companyâ€™s sales performance, product offerings, operations etc.
1.	Which period has the most Sales?  - To identify if there is any seasonality in sales as this will help to optimise management of inventories, staffing and timing of appropriate marketing campaigns.  
2.	What are the Top 5 most popular products for the various sales channels?  - To identify the most appropriate target products for TechScape to efficiently and effectively use marketing activities to engage customers.
3.	What are the Top & Bottom 5 branches in terms of profit ?  - Monitoring the top and bottom 5 branches in terms of gross profit enables TechScape to make informed decisions, optimize resources, drive improvement, and align its strategies to maximize overall sales and profitability.

Here are the Dashboards that I have created using PowerBI:
